                    This is how it was done.
                    First, we created index.html. This page is the main page with look and feel similar to a typical search result page. This page
                    lists multiple hotels.
                    <br /><br />Next we created individual pages for each hotels and attached them to index.html.
                    <br /><br />A common CSS file (Default.css) was created to control overall look and feel.
                    <br /><br />Chart.JS is used for displaying average room rate bar graph.
